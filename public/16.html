    <h1>Greatest Films of All Time</h1>
<h2>My personal list of greatest films</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Braveheart</h3>
<img src="../assets/images/Braveheart.jpg"> 
<p>An epic and inspiring story full of heart put to film! The historical inaccuracies are there, they don't make this masterpiece any less spectacular!</p>

<h3>No Country For Old Men</h3>
<img src="../assets/images/No Country.jpg">
<p>"No Country for Old Men" demonstrates a masterclass in gripping and nail-biting suspense, while having an unforgettably haunting antagonist in Anton Chigurh.</p>

<h3>Fight Club</h3>

<p>David Fincher did good with this one. Amazing movie, stellar cast all excels in character. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton delivers in spectacular fashion. Very well written. Great cinematography and visually visceral and convincing. Lots of action, drama, dilemma and emotion. Masterpiece and very memorable</p>
